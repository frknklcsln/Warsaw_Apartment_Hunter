## 🎯 Project Overview

**Warsaw Apartment Hunter** frames apartment search as a multi-objective optimization problem, combining listings, public transport data, and advanced algorithms to recommend apartments that minimize commute time and cost while maximizing value.

- **Objective:** Minimize total commute cost and time, maximize apartment quality
- **Constraints:** Budget, area, transport accessibility, private ownership
- **Decision Variables:** Apartment selection, optimal routes

## Mathematical Formulation

**Objective Function**

$$
\min f(x) = \alpha \cdot \text{Rent}(x) + \beta \cdot \text{CommuteTime}(x) + \gamma \cdot \text{TransportCost}(x)
$$

**Subject to Constraints**

$$
\text{Rent}(x) \leq \text{Budget}_{\max}
$$

$$
\text{Area}(x) \geq \text{Area}_{\min}
$$

$$
\text{CommuteTime}(x) \leq \text{Time}_{\max}
$$

$$
\text{OwnerType}(x) = \text{"Private"}
$$

$$
\text{AccessibilityScore}(x) \geq \text{Threshold}
$$

Where $x$ represents the selected apartment from the feasible set $X$.

## ⚡️ Why a Vectorized DataFrame Approach?

- **🚀 Blazing Fast for Batch Processing:**  
  Vectorized operations (Pandas, CuPy) allow us to process thousands of apartments and millions of GTFS records in parallel, leveraging both CPU and GPU acceleration.

- **🧮 Scalable for Large Datasets:**  
  This approach is ideal for static, high-volume analysis where you want to evaluate all apartment-to-office routes at once, rather than one at a time.

- **🛠️ Simpler Implementation:**  
  No need to build or maintain a complex graph structure—GTFS data is processed as tables, making the pipeline easier to maintain and extend.

- **💾 Lower Memory Footprint:**  
  Only the necessary data is loaded and processed; there’s no need to keep a full transport network graph in memory.

- **🔎 Perfect for Point-to-Point Analysis:**  
  Since most users want to know the best commute from each apartment to a single office location, table-based filtering and aggregation is both fast and accurate.

- **⚡️ GPU-Accelerated Spatial Queries:**  
  CuPy is used for fast Haversine distance calculations, making spatial filtering of apartments and stops extremely efficient.

- **🧠 Extensible:**  
  If needed, graph-based routing (e.g., NetworkX, Dijkstra) can be layered on top for more complex, multi-leg journeys—but for this project’s use case, vectorized dataframes are optimal.
